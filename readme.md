# Python-calculator
## Brief introduction
I worked on this project for school, as we had to create a maths-based tkinter GUI application. I chose a calculator, which just had the basic operations of +, -, x, /, =, CLR and the numbers.

This was my first experience with GUI work, and not long after decided to move into further web development.
